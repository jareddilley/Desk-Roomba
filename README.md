Miniaturized Roomba that can dust all your surfaces. This is a fully 3D-printed robot that can avoid objects, avoid falling off the edge of a table, and dust the surface as it goes. The idea was built off of the SMARs robot that can be found on Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2662828). I made some additions of my own to better suit my needs. This creation has a YouTube video as well so those who are visual learners can be entertained: Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM7q85V_2Z0

# Object Detection

The robot can avoid objects by using an ultrasonic sensor. This was the only sensor already built into the original design. The sensor bounces ultrasonic sound off the object and listens back for the echo. The time between send and receive determines the distance. In code, we can vary how close the object can get before turning around. 

# Edge Detection

The robot can keep itself from folling off the edge by usining an ir sensor.

# Duster

The duster is a simple microfiber towel that is attached to a sweeper. The fabric is held in with wedges: this follows the idea of a sanding block to keep the sanding paper in place while under load. The broken down 3d model can be seen below:
